![cover_photo](readme/car_image.jpg)

# Summary

Cars fill the roads and occupy the parking lots and driveways of owners all of over the world. The sale of cars is a massive market and used car sales is a portion of that. The following project takes a dataset of used car data from craigslist and, using data munging, data anlysis and machine learning, results in a machine learning model to predict used car price based on features of the vehicle.

**Data**

This data is scraped every few months, it contains most all relevant information that Craigslist provides on car sales including columns like price, condition, manufacturer, latitude/longitude, and 18 other categories.

**Solution Approach**
  - Understand the given data thoroughly. What are the features and what are the values.
  - Data Wrangling. Resolve missing values. Check for categorical variables inconsistencies. Check for numerical outliers. 
  - Exploratory data analysis. Visualize the data in different forms to get insights into. Find out relations between target and each data column.
  - Preproccessing. Normalize features included distribution and scaling.
  - Create different models based on Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Forest, Linear Regression
  - Compare models to find best one to predict care price.
    
**Deliverables**
  - Developed Code in Python Notebooks
  - Final Report with findings
  - Slide deck
  - Tableau Dashboard
